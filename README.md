#BUGS

-/ App does not work on heroku
-/ Had to remove <%= render 'new_comment' %>  from app/views/products/show.html.erb or else the page will not load
  --/ This means that new comments cannot be created dynamically on the web app

#CSS, RESPONSIVE

-/ We have to make that search bar a little more aesthetically pleasing when it gets below 768px.

#CSS, AESTHETICS

-/ ABOUT and ORDERS need the whole Spa treatment

-/ INDEX and CONTACT need a little work content

-/ PRODUCTS just needs a nice look for the details below each picture.
