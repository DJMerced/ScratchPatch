#BUGS


#CSS, RESPONSIVE

-/ All pages should be (at this point) at least nicely designed for laptop screens, but make sure that they are responsive everywhere

#CSS, AESTHETICS

-/  Style the pages
  --/ Tablet - Laptop:
    ---/  ORDERS
          DEVISE (and its sub-pages)
          USER (and its sub-pages)

#OTHER

-/ **PAGINATION**, did not include __@products = Product.all.paginate(page: params[:page], per_page: 3)__ because I do not understand it's purpose yet (unless it's just to list 3 products per page and I have just been coding it wrong?)
