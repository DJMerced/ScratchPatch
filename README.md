#######################################   ISSUES   #####################################################

#BUGS

-/ App does not work on heroku

#CSS, RESPONSIVE

-/ All pages should be (at this point) at least nicely designed for laptop screens, but make sure that they are responsive everywhere

#CSS, AESTHETICS

-/ Every main page needs to be prettied up :

  --/ ORDERS
  --/ ABOUT

  --/ PRODUCTS
      ---/ INDEX (really just to make the rows of data beneath each picture nice)
      ---/ SHOW

      ---/ Eventually all pages will have to be spruced up including DEVISE pages, PRODUCT sub-pages, USER pages, and thank_you page

-/ Figure out why comments rating does not show star icons

#OTHER

-/ **PAGINATION**, did not include __@products = Product.all.paginate(page: params[:page], per_page: 3)__ because I do not understand it's purpose yet (unless it's just to list 3 products per page and I have just been coding it wrong?)
