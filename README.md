#BUGS

-/ App does not work on heroku

#CSS, RESPONSIVE

-/ We have to make that search bar a little more aesthetically pleasing when it gets below 768px.

#CSS, AESTHETICS

-/ Every page needs to be prettied up

-/Figure out why comments rating does not show star icons

#OTHER

-/ **PAGINATION**, did not include __@products = Product.all.paginate(page: params[:page], per_page: 3)__ because I do not understand it's purpose yet (unless it's just to list 3 products per page and I have just been coding it wrong?)
